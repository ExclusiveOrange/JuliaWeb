# JuliaWeb

A web-based, interactive fractal image explorer specifically for filled Julia sets.

## What

A [fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) is a particular type of thing that has a self-repeating pattern.
JuliaWeb makes pictures of a particular type of fractal called a [Julia set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).

## Why

Because neat things are neat.

## How

Fractals of this sort can be imaged (approximately) by doing many maths ---
particularly, simple repetitive arithmetic.
The procedure is very simple, but to make a *neat* image, a great many arithmetics are needed.
JuliaWeb uses JavaScript and some features of HTML5 to convince a computer to do all the arithmetics
in the right way, and then to display an image for humans.

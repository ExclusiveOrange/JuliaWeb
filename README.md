# JuliaWeb

A web-based, interactive fractal explorer.
Initially just for the filled Julia set approximation, but now can also do mutatable versions of the Mandelbrot set and the Burning Ship thing.

## What

A [fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) is a particular type of thing that has a self-repeating pattern.
JuliaWeb makes pictures of approximations of certain kinds of fractals on the complex plane.
I'm not sure that the mutable Mandlebrot and Burning Ship are even fractals in a strict sense, but they look neat.

## Why

Because neat things are neat.

## How

Fractals of this sort can be imaged (approximately) by doing many maths ---
particularly, simple repetitive arithmetic.
The procedure is very simple, but to make a *neat* image, a great many arithmetics are needed.
JuliaWeb uses JavaScript and some features of HTML5 to convince a computer to do all the arithmetics
in the right way, and then to display an image for humans.

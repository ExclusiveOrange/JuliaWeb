## What

### This is?

JuliaWeb is a web-based, interactive fractal explorer.
Its codes are JavaScript.
It's intended for easy-use by non-mathers.

### Fractals are?

A [fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) is a particular type of thing that has a self-repeating pattern.
This fractal explorer makes interactive pictures of certain kinds of fractals.
It might be that the mutatable Mandelbrot and mutatable Burning Ship aren't technically fractals, but I don't care.

## Why

Because neat things are neat.

## How

Fractals of this sort can be imaged (approximately) by doing many maths &mdash;
particularly, simple repetitive arithmetic.
The procedure is very simple, but to make a *neat* image, a great many arithmetics are needed.
This fractal explorer uses JavaScript and some features of HTML5 to convince a computer to do all the arithmetics
in the right way, and then to display an image for humans.
